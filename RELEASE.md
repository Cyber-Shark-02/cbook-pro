## 🚀 Introducing CBook Pro
We are proud to introduce **CBook Pro**, the ultimate VS Code extension for developers who need more than just a text editor. CBook Pro transforms your favorite IDE into a powerful, multi-language notebook environment, blending the interactivity of Jupyter with the raw power of compiled languages.

**One Notebook. Five Languages. Limitless Possibilities.**

## 🔥 Why CBook Pro?

### 1. � True Polyglot Experience
Stop switching between IDEs. Write **Python** for data analysis, **C++** for algorithms, and **Java** for backend logic—all in the same notebook file.
*   **Supported:** Python 🐍, C, C++, Java ☕, JavaScript (Node.js) ⚡.

### 2. 🧠 Intelligent Python Kernel
Experience Python as it was meant to be:
*   **Persistent State:** Variables, functions, and classes live across cells. Build complex workflows step-by-step.
*   **Stateless Mode (Pro):** Need to test a script in isolation? Toggle **Stateless Mode** on any cell to run it in a fresh, clean process instantly.
*   **Interactive Inputs:** User prompts (`input()`) work seamlessly inline.
*   **Data Visualization:** Render `matplotlib` charts directly in your output.

### 3. ⚡ Native Performance
CBook Pro doesn't rely on heavy remote kernels or sluggish containers.
*   **Local Execution:** Your code runs on your machine, using your local compilers (`gcc`, `g++`, `javac`).
*   **Speed:** Instant startup and execution with zero overhead.
*   **Standard I/O:** Full support for standard input/output streams across all languages.
