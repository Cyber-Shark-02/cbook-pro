## ✨ Features & Advantages

### 🐍 **Professional Python Environment**
*   **Stateful Persistence:** Define a variable in Cell 1, use it in Cell 10. A true interactive session.
*   **Stateless Isolation:** A unique feature allowing you to toggle any specific cell to run in a **clean, isolated process**. Perfect for testing scripts without side effects.
*   **Rich Media:** View `matplotlib` plots and charts inline.
*   **Real-Time Input:** Seamlessly handle `input()` user prompts.

### 💻 **Compiled Language Power (C / C++ / Java)**
*   **Live Compilation:** Write C or C++ code and run it instantly. We handle the compilation and linking behind the scenes.
*   **Standard Streams:** Full `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` support. Great for teaching algorithms and data structures.
*   **Process Safety:** Automatic resource management ensures no hanging processes.

### ⚡ **Modern JavaScript**
*   **Node.js Integration:** Rapidly prototype JS logic using your local Node environment.
*   **JSON Output:** Clean rendering of object data.

## 🎯 Use Cases

*   **Education:** Create interactive lesson plans mixing lecture notes (Markdown) and runnable code examples in C++ or Java.
*   **Data Science:** Perform data analysis with Python, visualize results, and keep your workspace clean.
*   **Algorithm Practice:**Solve LeetCode style problems in C or Java with immediate feedback and no boilerplate project setup.
*   **Prototyping:** Validating logic snippets before moving them to your main codebase.
